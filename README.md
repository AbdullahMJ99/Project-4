## Description

We predict housing prices based on features derived from the Ames, Iowa housing data set, containing residential property sales from 2006 - 2010. Two different machine learning models are used, a neural network and a random forest.

`regression_models.ipynb` contains the final models.

`exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` contains multiple plots displaying the data and the very first neural network. Subsequent neural network models are contained in the `./trial_models/` folder. `nn_template.ipynb` shows the keras tuner used to adjust hyperparameters during those trials.

## Usage

Restart the kernel and run `regression_models.ipynb`
