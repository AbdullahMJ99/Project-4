## Description

We predict housing prices based on features derived from the Ames, Iowa housing data set, containing residential property sales from 2006 - 2010. `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` contains multiple plots displaying the data and the very first neural network. Subsequent neural network models are contained in the `./trial_models/` folder.

## Usage
